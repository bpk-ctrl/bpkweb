  <h1>What is HTTPS?</h1>
  <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a secure communication protocol that is used to transfer data over the internet. HTTPS provides three key layers of protection:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encryption: HTTPS encrypts the data that is sent between your browser and the website, so that it cannot be intercepted and read by others.</li>
    <li>Data integrity: HTTPS ensures that the data that is sent between your browser and the website cannot be modified or corrupted during transmission.</li>
    <li>Authentication: HTTPS verifies that the website that you are connecting to is the correct website and not an imposter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Why is HTTPS important?</h2>
  <p>HTTPS is important because it helps to protect the privacy and security of your data when you are using the internet. Without HTTPS, your data can be intercepted and read by others, including hackers and cybercriminals. This can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of cybercrime. HTTPS also helps to prevent website spoofing, where a fake website is created to trick you into giving away your personal information.</p>
  <h2>How does HTTPS work?</h2>
  <p>HTTPS works by using a protocol called SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to establish a secure connection between your browser and the website. SSL/TLS uses a system of public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt the data that is sent between your browser and the website. The public key is used to encrypt the data, and the private key is used to decrypt it. This ensures that only the website that you are connecting to can read the data that is sent between your browser and the website.</p>
